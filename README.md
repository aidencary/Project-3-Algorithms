Project 3 Algorithms Dr. Hu

## Program Description
This program creates a graph using NetworkX and performs a breadth-first search (BFS) and depth-first search (DFS) on the graph. The graph is then drawn with a structured layout matching the given image in the project description. The BFS and DFS functions are called on the graph, and the visited nodes are printed. The graph is then drawn with the visited nodes highlighted in red.

## Order of Graphs Printed
1. Initial graph before a search

2. Graph after BFS search with visited nodes highlighted in red

3. Graph after DFS search with visited nodes highlighted in red


## Notes


- The BFS function ensures all vertices are visited by starting from any unvisited vertex until all vertices are visited.

- The DFS function ensures all vertices are visited by starting from any unvisited vertex until all vertices are visited.

## Algorithms Implemented

- Graph Algorithms:
  - Breadth-First Search (BFS)
  - Depth-First Search (DFS)

## Installation

- Ensure you have Python installed.
- Install the required libraries using pip:
  ```sh
  pip install networkx matplotlib
  ```
